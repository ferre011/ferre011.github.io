  <title>On Beginnings</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Paul Valéry, the French poet<br>
and thinker, once said<br>
that no poem is never ended,<br>
that every poem is merely abandoned.<br>
This saying is also attributed<br>
to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where<br>
quotations begin is in a cloud.<br>
Paul Valéry also described<br>
his perception of first lines so vividly,<br>
and to my mind so accurately,<br>
that i have never forgotten it:<br>
the opening line of a poem,<br>
he said, is like finding a fruit<br>
on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit<br>
you have never seen before,<br>
and the poet’s task is to create the tree<br>
from which such a fruit would fall.<br>

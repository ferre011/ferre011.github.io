  <title>On Beginnings</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same:</h1>

<h2>A phrase, a phrase, a phrase, a phrase.<br>
 a line, a line, a line, a line, a line, a line, <br>
a   s c r a p   o f   l a n g u a g e   ,<br>
a rhyyyyythm,<br>
a<br>
n<br>
i<br>
m<br>
a<br>
g<br>
e<br>
,<br>
something seen o-o,<br>
heard ))),<br>
witnessed...,<br>
or imagined???.</h2>

<p>And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you havenâ€™t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. <br>
I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.

<body>



  <h1>Mediterranean March, 2020</h1>
  <h2>March 2020. Silence. Other than the waves, all I hear is my breath. Everyone is locked inside their homes. Terrified by the causes of this unknown virus. and After quite some time with no fresh air, I have escaped at sea. The water temperature is cold. The chilly sand sticks to my humid feet, and I get goosebumps. I stand there, for a good twenty minutes. Breathing that fresh air and cherishing the moment filled with beauty. </h2>

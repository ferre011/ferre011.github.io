    <p1>1. When I was younger I used to take Computer Science classes and I remember using coding to create online games. Hoever, I don't particularly remember how it worked. Last semester, on the other hand, I better learnt how to code in Core 1 Interaction classes when I created my first website using code on Sublime Text.</p1>
    
    <p2>2. Core 1 Interaction.</p2>
    
    <p3>3. Being able to pick the sea as my theme and using gifs and different effects on Sublime text really resonated with me. </p3>
    
    <p4>4. Flexbox and JS were very confusing in my opinion.</p4>
    
    <p5>5. I am excited about learning code because I've always wanted to learn how it works very well. However I am a bit nervous because sometimes I forget the basic steps of coding - for instance even if something is explained in class and I make notes, after a couple of days, even if I read my notes, I tend to forget how to use some tools on different coding platforms. I think a way to help me and perhaps others not forgetting would be advising us online tutorials that we can use and that can help us. 
    
    <p6>6. Personally, I don't think I will be using much of coding in my carreer in the future, however I believe it is an excellent skill to have, both in life in general, and in the life of a designer.</p6>
    
    <p7>7. I only have experience with Sublime text, so I'm guessing Sublime text. However, some friends from NYUtold me that Dreamweaver is better than Sublime text, so maybe Dreamweaver too?</p7>
 
    <p8>8. Yes I have used GitHub in the past semester to upload/publish/"commit" my work on Sublime text to the web. It wasn't too complicated.</p8>
  
    <p9>9. In my experience,HTML,CSS and JavaScript complement each other, in the sense that when using Sublime text last semester I used them together. HTML, which is what I'm doing right now, is where one types the text to insert into their webpage using different tools such as html, title, head, body etc. placed in chevrons. CSS is what I use to make the page "pretty" selecting the typography, colors,and other details of my page. JavaScript, on the other hand, has been useful to me when it comes to interaction with the page, so flexbox if I remember well.</p9>

        I have an obsession with this website, not only because of their beautiful website but because I also love what their studio is about. The website well encapsulates their concept and i find it very interesting.

        I really adore Kein Studio's website because of how all the content is set out - I think it works very well because it is very tidy, neat, but also creative. 
        https://www.copystudio.it/
        Copy Studio's website is beautiful because of their simplicity and main page with hovering effects.

        18. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Block elements have top and bottom margins.
